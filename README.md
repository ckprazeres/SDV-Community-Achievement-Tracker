# Stardew Valley Community Achievement Tracker

A webapp that allows you to track your progress restoring the old [community center](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Community_Center) in the indie game [Stardew Valley](https://stardewvalley.net/). This app allows you to manually check off items that have already been delivered to the community center and displays a visual progress bar.
